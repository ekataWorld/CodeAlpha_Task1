📝 Project Name:
Hangman Word Guessing Game using Python

📌** Project Overview:
The Hangman Word Guessing Game is a text-based word puzzle game developed in Python. It allows the user to guess a hidden word by entering one letter at a time. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and logic-building skills in Python while offering an interactive and fun gameplay experience.
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list. The user must guess the word within a limited number of incorrect attempts (6). If the player guesses all the correct letters before the maximum attempts are reached, they win the game.

🎮 **Game Concept:
The concept is based on the traditional Hangman game. A word is chosen secretly, and the player must figure out the word by guessing its letters. For each wrong guess, a life is lost. The player either wins by guessing all letters or loses by exhausting all attempts.

Game Rules:
- The player can guess one letter at a time.
- If the letter exists in the word, it is revealed.
- If not, one incorrect guess is counted.
- The player has 6 incorrect guesses total.
- Game ends with either a win or a loss.

💻 **Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Editor Used: VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE
Libraries Used: random (to select a word randomly)

🌟 **Features:
- Easy to play text-based game.
- User input is validated.
- Keeps track of correct and wrong guesses.
- Friendly messages and game result display.
  
✅ **Conclusion:
This Hangman game project helped in understanding how to write and structure a Python program. It uses basic programming logic and helps beginners improve their skills while making a fun game. It can be further expanded into a full application in the future.
